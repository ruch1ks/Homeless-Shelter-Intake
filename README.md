# Homeless-Shelter-Intake
A website allowing homeless shelters to intake users and store their information, including their most urgently needed donation items. The goal of this website is to allow for homeless shelter websites to list items that are most urgently needed in real-time, as this is not currently possible.

# Setup
Clone this repository and navigate to the /comp426-backend-master folder. Use npm run dev-static to run the server. In a separate terminal, navigate to /homeless-shelter. In this folder, run npm install to install dependencies and npm start to start up the frontend.
